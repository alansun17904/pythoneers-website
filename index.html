                Learning This is a middle-school club at <abbr title="International School of Beijing">ISB</abbr> co-founded by Alan Sun and George Wu in their sophmore year of highschool. The mission of the club was to introduce computer concepts to students of a younger age and allow for further individual exploration of more advanced computer science topics.

                Students will first be introduced to the basic domains of computer science, then they will be given a brief introduction to software development and what problem-solving looks like when programming. As the year progresses students will be introduced to the basic building blocks of programming: types, operators, if-statements, iteration, and object-oriented programming. They will also be exploring many APIs that can interact with the online world. Many programming classes only teach the syntax of the programming langauge, however, few cover why these things can actually happen, that is also an important part of our computer-science explorations.

                I started programming in my freshman year of highschool. I started programming not for the sole purpose of programming, rather because I had a need, a project to work on.

                I have always been amazed by the potential of programming and the power it gives people. Curious and wanting to use technology to its highest potential, I experimented with various programming languages at a young age. After dabbling around with computer science and various programming languages in my middle school years, I finally decided to take some time to properly learn Python in my sophomore year of high school as a hobby. I was drawn to Python due to its simplicity and readability, on top of its immense capability in fields as advanced as artificial intelligence. Granted, I’m not that good yet, but knowing that I have that option open for me as long as I keep learning is exciting. In addition to Python, I have some knowledge in JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I’m psyched to share my knowledge with aspiring young programmers in the years to come; hopefully, some of you will discover the joy in programming and do big things in the future!
