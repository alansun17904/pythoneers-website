                <p>
                Learning This is a middle-school club at <abbr title="International School of Beijing">ISB</abbr> co-founded by Alan Sun and George Wu in their sophmore year of highschool. The mission of the club was to introduce computer concepts to students of a younger age and allow for further individual exploration of more advanced computer science topics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Students will first be introduced to the basic domains of computer science, then they will be given a brief introduction to software development and what problem-solving looks like when programming. As the year progresses students will be introduced to the basic building blocks of programming: types, operators, if-statements, iteration, and object-oriented programming. They will also be exploring many APIs that can interact with the online world. Many programming classes only teach the syntax of the programming langauge, however, few cover why these things can actually happen, that is also an important part of our computer-science explorations.

                I started programming in my freshman year of highschool. I started programming not for the sole purpose of programming, rather because I had a need, a project to work on.
